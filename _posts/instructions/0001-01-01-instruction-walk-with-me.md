# Instructions

## Step 1: Download the package

The Walk With Me package will contain 3 tracks (mp3s), and a map.
Drop the three mp3 files into iTunes or your preferred music app and and make sure the tracks end up in your ipod/mp3 player. Take a listen to Track 1 before taking the walk. It will give you a chance to set your volume and direct you to the starting point of the walk.

TIP: Make sure that you can also hear the surrounding sounds in real life.

## Step 2: Print the map

Read the directions, and note where you need to be crossing, as indicated on the map.

TIP: Being able to mentally place yourself geographically before you walk, will take the work out for you, and allow you to enjoy the audiowalk more. Please remember to cross safely!

## Step 3: Now you’re ready to walk! (Grab a pair of comfy shoes!)

Since everyone has their own walking pace, you’d definitely need to make this walk your own by pausing, especially when crossing busy streets even re-winding where you need to.

TIP 1: If using a smartphone, make sure that you switch it to the Airplane Mode for the duration of the walk. This way, your calls and texts won’t disrupt the audiowalk.

TIP 2: Needless to say, pick a nice day. If walking with a friend, make sure you each have a map. Keep an eye out for each other but know that you may be out of synch so be ready to walk independently and be immersed in your own experience.
