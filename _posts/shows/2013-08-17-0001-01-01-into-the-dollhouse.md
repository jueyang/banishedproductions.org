_Into the Dollhouse_ is an original devised-movement performance that explores girlhood, nostalgia and looking back in order to walk forward. The piece takes inspiration from Meredith Monk’s _Education of the Girl Child_, Anna Halprin’s _Parades & Changes_, selected text from Charles Mee’s _Salome_, and songs from yesteryear that trigger reminiscing.
